# ticket-number-generator
A friend asked me to modify a PDF generating 1000 numbered copies for a raffle for the town's local festivities, so that's what I did.

# Requirements
```
pip3.9 install PyPDF2 reportlab
```

# Run
Make sure to have a "tickets" folder & change pdf file name in the code by your pdf file name
```
python3.9 script.py
```
